The study implements an application that can effectively integrate AI models into phishing email detection. The application developed in this study allows users to detect phishing emails with a high degree of accuracy while also providing URL detection in emails. 
The users first need to download the AI model using the model-downloaded script. Then, they need to run the file called final_app. A successful run will display the user interface, including a model selection box and a text entry box. Model selection is mandatory; otherwise, an error will happen, and the mail will not be detected. After selecting the model and entering the subject of the mail, click on the “phishing detection” button to get the result. The result will show whether the email is phishing or not and display all the RULs in the email and whether the URLs are phishing URLs or not.
The application can also add other models and training with the latest dataset. If users need to download and use other trained models, they can achieve it by changing the files in the phishing_detection folder. The model’s name needs to be added to the model_names in the model-download.py; after download, the model name needs to be added to the model_paths in final_app.py. If the user wants to train with the latest dataset, they need to change dataset_files in the Data_Preprocessing file featured-phishing-detection folder. After training, they can get their personal AI model.
